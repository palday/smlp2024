     <h3>Brief history of the summer school, and motivation</h3>

The summer school was started by Shravan Vasishth in 2017, as part of a <a
href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/sfb1287/projects/infrastructure-service-training-and-central-projects/project-q.html">methods
project</a> funded within the <a
href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/sfb1287/index.html">SFB 1287</a>. The summer
school aims to fill a gap in statistics education, specifically within the
fields of linguistics and psychology. One goal of the summer school is to
provide comprehensive training in the theory and application of statistics, with
a special focus on the linear mixed model.  Another major goal is to make
Bayesian data analysis a standard part of the toolkit for the linguistics and
psychology researcher. Over time, the summer school has evolved to have at least
four parallel streams: foundational and advanced courses in frequentist and
Bayesian statistics. These may be expanded to more parallel sessions in future
editions. We typically admit a total of 120 participants (in 2019, we had some
450 applications). In addition to the all-day courses, we regularly invite
speakers to give lectures on important current issues relating to statistics.
Previous editions of the summer school: <a

     <h3>Courses</h3>

Coming soon.

<h3>Fees and accommodation</h3>

There will be a 40 Euro fee; this covers costs for coffee and snacks. Participants who are accepted are expected to arrange their own accommodation. We strongly advise participants to find a place to stay near Griebnitzsee campus, and not in Berlin. The reason is that German train personnel tend to go on strike every year around the time of the summer school. You will be better off if you can get easily to the Griebnitzsee campus.
